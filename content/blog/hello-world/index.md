I’m an 18-year-old high school senior from IES Estados Del Duque, Spain. I write code,co-founder of Malagon Hack Club, and enjoy reading.📚

I'’m passionate about bringing tech opportunities to people who don’t have them, particularly to students in Malagon. From my to the Hack Club I lead at my school, I try to make an impact with everything I do.

Oh, and here's a great quote from the Internet on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller).

> “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.” -Helen Keller
