Wow! I love blogging so much already.

###### About me

Hi, my name is Miruna and I am a student at IES Estados Del Duque Spain.
I started self teaching programming in early 2017, and was fascinated
with the idea of being able to create whatever I wanted, and learn how to do so
off of the internet. I started off with basic web development, but
things really changed when I attended a hackathon in Berlin. After I saw the amazing
hacker community, I devoted more and more of my time to coding. I eventually started organizing events, and hosting workshops. After this, I also got involved with Hack Club,
and have been an active member of the community.

###### Events

Some of my most defining and impactful work is organizing events to educate
others about computer science.I also love meeting new people :)
