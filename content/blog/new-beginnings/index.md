---

Programming is a superpower, and I’m greatly thankful for having discovered that fact early on in my life. I’m a student at IES Estados Del Duque with a deep passion for computer science and creating change. My goals are to create positively impactful software and to constantly develop the skills necessary to do so.
During my junior year of high school, I attended my first hackathon, which was when I decided this is what I want to do.
I`m currently co-founder of Malagon Hack Club, where together with an international non-profit organization we created a community of hackers, makers and creators in my town.

## Co-founder of Hack Club Malagón

Malagón Hack Club is the IES Estados del Duque High School’s Hack Club, where students learn to code by making fun projects. Meetings run for an hour and a half after school on Fridays and are structured like mini-hackathons, with free food, free stuff, swag and fun at every meeting.

It is currently the only high school hack club in all **Spain**. I am one of the co-founders of it for Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 Seasons. My responsibility involves all kinds of marketing affair and running social media, which is crucial for the expansion and growth of the organization.

Due to the efforts, our club has grown incredibly the past few moths,we participated in two competitions and had our teachers involved as well in the hack club workshops.

We are a non-profit organization by students, for students. We are all about bringing together passionate students to engage in collaborative coding and build projects that solve real problems. Our goal is to build a hacker community network here on Spain, with an emphasis placed on innovation and entrepreneurship.

### My experience on Private teaching

I guided high school students in one-on-one sessions covering topics like Physics, Maths, and English for two years.

### Leader of the Programming Group

CanSats in Europe is an initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA), which also supports national CanSat events with the help of local organisations. These organisations are collaborating to increase the support for CanSat activities in Europe.

A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can. The challenge for the students is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a communication system, into this minimal volume. The CanSat is then launched to an altitude of a few hundred metres by a rocket or dropped from a platform or captive balloon and its mission begins: to carry out a scientific experiment and achieve a safe landing.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox
advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.

##### Wherever far wow thus a squirrel raccoon jeez jaguar this from along

She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on
the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a
rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she
met a copy.

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her
for their projects again and again.
